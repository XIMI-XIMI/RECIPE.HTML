                     <dd>That is say an hour in the morning is worth two in the evening.Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Many people choose to abandon breakfast because they are late, which is an unwise choice. Therefore, I decided to share the recipes of the breakfast combinations I often eat with everyone. That's salads, sandwiches, and soups. This recipe is simple and time-consuming to make and is best for people who are often late. Drink some warm soup to warm your stomach, then eat a sandwich full of protein, and finally use a salad to reduce your greasiness. A breakfast can allow us to absorb all kinds of nutrients, why not do it?</dd>

                    <dd>What, to you, is the perfect simple salad? I’m not talking lunch salads or grain salads, but the simplest of dinner accompaniments, the salad that gets tossed at the last moment to lay beside a piece of grilled chicken or a plate of pasta. This kind of salad often feels like an afterthought. It’s the obligatory vegetable to be munched down before enjoying the rest of your dinner. But this doesn’t need to be so! Here are some thoughts, tips, and directions to help you turn your side salad into the most delicious part of the meal.</dd>

                    <dd>The best sandwiches don’t happen by accident: You’ve got to balance moisture and crunch, weigh condiments against main components, choose bread that will make each element shine, then construct it all so that every bite delivers something far greater than the sum of its parts.

                        Whether stuffed with meat, eggs, cheese, or vegetables, the sandwich transcends borders, uniting cultures, peoples, and cuisines. Take, for example, Cuba’s medianoche sandwich with roast pork, ham, and Swiss cheese on a sweet egg loaf, and Vietnam’s banh mi with Chinese-style barbecue pork, fresh cucumbers, and mayo on French bread.The South’s pimento cheese, and Turkey’s kumru, a briny grilled cheese with sucuk sausage, spicy pickles, and tomatoes on a sesame roll. The world’s best sandwiches have much in common.</dd>
